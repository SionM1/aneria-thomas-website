Aneira Thomas is a contemporary artist based in Cardiff, Wales. Her work explores the beauty of the natural world through abstract and figurative paintings.
Aneira's work draws attention to the intricate patterns and textures found in the natural world, celebrating details that are often overlooked. Her paintings focus on organic rhythms - such as the veins in leaves, the ripples of water, or the textures of bark - inviting viewers to engage with the quiet yet enduring beauty that shapes our environment.

## Artistic Practice

Thomas's process is integral to her practice, encouraging a sense of slowness and reflection. By making her own paints and materials, she deepens her connection to the work, creating pieces that embody care and intentionality. Working with oil paints and distemper, she builds her surfaces through a careful layering process, allowing textures and repeated forms to emerge gradually.

Her use of bold, vibrant colour emphasises these natural elements, while the interplay of pattern and texture mirrors the harmony and complexity of the natural world. Through this approach, Thomas transforms the familiar into something deeply resonant.

## Medium and Technique

Thomas includes many slower paced methods in her practice such as making natural pigments, hand stretched canvases and distemper to encourage her audience to also slow down and take a moment with her paintings. Along with distemper she uses oil paints to bring vibrancy to the paintings. Using these mediums allows her to work with several layers that weave into one harmonious surface.

## Artist Statement

Throughout her work, Thomas celebrates the overlooked, small and delicate details of nature through the use of repetition and patterns that are hidden in day-to-day life. Colour and pattern are important in her aesthetic focus when creating her work, as well as focusing on intuitive responses to the medium.

By honing in on the intricate details of the everyday and embracing a process rooted in slowness and attention, her work inspires a renewed appreciation for the beauty and complexity of the natural world, offering a space for reflection and connection.
